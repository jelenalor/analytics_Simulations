### Single Serve Queuing System Simulation
*July 2019*

<br>

**Author - Jelena Lor**

*Statistics - Poisson and Uniform distribution*

<br>


*Includes interactive visualization which will only run on your own PC, please feel free to download the notebook*
*(jupyter lab is not yet compatable with interactive visualizations, you can run it via anaconda prompt)*


Running simulation shows:
- How many customers in the store during any point of time (20 minutes time lapse)
- How many time the store is closed late by 20, 40 etc minutes

If we decrease the serving time from (between 3 - 8 minutes) to (between 2 - 4 minutes) closing time is 5 pm and no backlog of customers in the line.

**The second interactive visualisation simulates the store queuing system X number of times and outlines how many times the store will stay open late for 10 minutes, 20 minutes etc**

About 200 out of 830 simulations will result the store being late for 10 minutes, when serve time is between 2 and 5 minutes and on average there are 6 customers per hour.

If we increase serve time to be between 4 - 9 minutes, we see the store will stay late for 20 and 30 minutes on a few occasions and 10 minutes late most of the time.

Similar impact is achieved when the serve time stays 2 - 5 minutes but the average number of customers per hour doubled.
